To pull the commits from github : git pull origin branch_name
GIT PULL = GIT FETCH + GIT MERGE
fetch : check the changes from central
if changes are present then we will merge to local
merge : getting the chages from github
To fetch the changes from github : git fetch origin branch_name
To merge the commits from github : git merge origin/branch_name
commit some files in local
Now link github repo to local system : git remote add origin github-repo-url

To push all branches at a time : git push -u origin --all
To know what are the repo that we connected to github : git remote -v
To pull the commits from github : git pull origin branch_name
GIT PULL = GIT FETCH + GIT MERGE
fetch : check the changes from central
if changes are present then we will merge to local
merge : getting the chages from github
To fetch the changes from github : git fetch origin branch_name
To merge the commits from github : git merge origin/branch_name
commit some files in local
Now link github repo to local system : git remote add origin github-repo-url
Now push the source code to github : git push -u origin branch_name
Then it will ask username : provider github username
Now it will ask password : generate a token and paste here
